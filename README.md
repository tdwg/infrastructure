# TDWG infrastructure

This repository is used for tracking [tasks and issues](https://github.com/tdwg/tdwg.org/issues) related to the TDWG infrastructure (https://www.tdwg.org, http://www.lsid.info, etc.) that are intended for public consumption.

Components that would result in sensitive info, expose security concerns or are not intended for public eyes should *not* be lodged in this repository, but the relevant private repo.
